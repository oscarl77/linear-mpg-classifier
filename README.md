# Binary Classification using custom-built Perceptron algorithm

Built, trained and tested a Perceptron to achieve a test accuracy of 90.82%.
The Perceptron classified cars as either good or bad mpg (miles per gallon), through manual thresholding, based on features such as engine cylinder count, horsepower, weight and more.

This project visualizes model performance via PCA and Confusion matrices.
